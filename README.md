# WordList

Say you're reading a book and you come across a new word. You want to know what the word means, and you also want to remember the word for future reference. Just type the word into the WordList app. The app shows a dictionary definition of the word and adds it to your word list so you can come back and find it again. The app stores definitions of words offline, so you don't need to be connected to the Internet to look up the meaning of a word you added to your word list. You can also export your word list as a file.
